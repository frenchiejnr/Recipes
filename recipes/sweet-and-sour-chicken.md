# Dump-and-Bake Sweet and Sour Chicken

## info  
* About 40 minutes  
* 4 servings  
* Cuisine: Chinese

## ingredients
* 1 ½ lbs. boneless, skinless chicken breasts cut into 1 ½-inch pieces
- 1 tablespoon cornstarch
- ½ cup diced onion
- 1 medium green bell pepper diced
- 1 medium red bell pepper diced
- ½ cup ketchup
- ¼ cup apple cider vinegar
- ¼ cup brown sugar
- 2 tablespoons soy sauce
- 1 teaspoon minced garlic
- ½ teaspoon ground ginger
- For serving: cooked rice (or cauliflower rice for a grain-free option)
- Optional garnish: sliced green onions; sesame seeds

## steps  
1. Preheat oven to 425 degrees F. Spray a medium baking dish with cooking spray
2. Place chicken in the prepared dish. Sprinkle with cornstarch and toss to coat.
3. Stir in onion and bell peppers.
4. In a separate bowl, whisk together ketchup, vinegar, brown sugar, soy sauce, garlic and ginger. Pour sauce over chicken and vegetables; stir to combine.
5. Bake, uncovered, for 25 minutes. Stir, return to the oven for 5-10 more minutes, or until chicken is cooked through and sauce has slightly thickened. If you find that your sauce is too thick when the chicken is done baking, you can add a splash of warm water (as necessary), and stir to thin.
6. Serve over hot cooked rice, if desired. Garnish with sliced green onions and sesame seeds.
