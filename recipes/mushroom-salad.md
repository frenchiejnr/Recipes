# Mushroom Salad

## info
* N/A   
* 6 servings  

## ingredients
* 1 box button mushrooms, diced
- ½ large red pepper, diced
- 2 scallions, thinly sliced
- ½ large avocado, diced (optional)
- 2 generous handfuls candied pecans, chopped

Dressing
- 1½ heaping Tbsp mayo (low fat is fine)
- 1½ heaping Tbsp brown sugar
- 1½ Tbsp soy sauce
- salt and pepper, to taste

## steps  
1. Place mushrooms, red pepper, scallions, and avocado, if using, in a medium-sized bowl. 
2. Mix dressing ingredients together in a small bowl. 
3. Add to veggies and stir to coat evenly. You can add the candied pecans to the veggies and mix in, or use them as a garnish.
 

## notes  
* You can sauté the mushrooms in some olive oil for a few minutes before assembling the salad. We don’t — we like it au naturel! Also, I often mix baby bella and button mushrooms for richer flavor.
