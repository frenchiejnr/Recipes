## Ingredients

- 1 brown onion

- 1 tbsp curry powder
- 2 carrots
- 130g basmati rice
- 250g british beef mince
- 1 tomato paste sachet (32g)
- 1 beef stock mix sachet (11g)
- Pepper 
- salt 
- sugar
- vegetable oil

## steps
1. 
   - Peel and finely slice the brown onion[s]
  
   - Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid), with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat
  
   - Once hot, add the sliced onion with a pinch of salt and sugar and cook for 3 min, or until starting to soften, then add the beef mince and cook for a further 3 min, breaking it up with a wooden spoon as you go

2. 
   - Top, tail, peel and chop the carrots into small, bite-sized pieces

   - Peel (scrape the skin off with a teaspoon) and grate (or finely chop) the ginger

   - Peel and grate (or finely chop) the garlic

3. 
   - Add the chopped carrot, grated ginger and grated garlic to the pan and cook for 1 min

4. 
   - Crumble the Knorr beef stock cube[s] into the pan, then add the tomato paste and curry powder and give everything a good mix up

5. 
   - Stir the basmati rice into the pan

6. 
   - Add 300ml [600ml] cold water to the pan and bring to the boil over a high heat
  
   - Once boiling, reduce the heat to low and cook, covered for 12-15 min or until the rice is cooked and the water has been absorbed
  
   - Check and stir occasionally to prevent the rice from sticking to the bottom
  
   - Tip: Add a splash of water if the rice looks a little dry!


7. 
   - Meanwhile, cut the lime[s] in half
   
   - Chop the mint finely, including the stalks
  
   - Stir the chopped mint and juice of 1/2 [1] lime through the cooked rice â€“ this is your beef keema
  
   - Taste for seasoning, adding more salt and pepper if needed
   
   - Chop the remaining lime into wedges
   
   - Serve the beef keema in bowls and garnish with the lime wedges
   
   - Enjoy!
