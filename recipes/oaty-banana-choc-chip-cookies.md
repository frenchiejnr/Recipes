# Oaty Banana Choc Chip Cookies

## info  
* N/A  
* 16 servings  

## ingredients
- 2 large ripe bananas
- 150g Scottish porridge oats
- 100g milk chocolate chips

## steps  
1. Mash 2 large ripe bananas in a mixing bowl with a fork until quite smooth. Mix in 150g oats until well coated in the banana, then fold through 100g milk chocolate chips.
2. Use a tablespoon to scoop out 16 balls of dough. Dollop onto a large baking tray lined with baking paper, leaving a gap between each cookie as they will spread slightly when baked. Gently press down and pat the cookies into a rough round shape.
3. Bake at gas 5, 190°C, fan 170°C for 18 mins or until just crisp and golden. The cookies should still be slightly soft and chewy in the middle.
4. Allow to cool before serving. 

## notes  
* The baked cookies will keep for up to 2 days stored in an airtight container.
